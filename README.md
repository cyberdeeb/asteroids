# Asteroids Game - README

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the classic **Asteroids Game** using **Python** and the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The goal is to build a fun, interactive game while reinforcing Python and OOP concepts.

## Purpose

The project serves as both a learning experience and a portfolio piece, showcasing skills in:

- **Python programming**
- **Game development basics**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Animation and interaction** using a library like `pygame`

## Features

- Control a spaceship to dodge or destroy asteroids.
- Random asteroid generation with varying speeds and sizes.
- Scoring system for destroyed asteroids.
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.

## Goals

1. **Apply OOP principles:** Break the game into modular components like spaceship, asteroid, and game controller.
2. **Develop a user-friendly experience:** Use smooth animations and responsive controls.
3. **Learn and grow:** Gain practical knowledge of Python and improve problem-solving skills through iterative development.
